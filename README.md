## Introduction
The application follows the principles of OOP:
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
Java Database Connectivity
JavaFX
MVC Model
By using OOP concepts, the program becomes more organized, maintainable, and extensible. It separates concerns and allows us to focus on specific functionalities within individual classes.
